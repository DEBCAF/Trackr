This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Supabase account setup

1. Create your account in Supabase Authentication with email and password.
2. Run `supabase/transactions_rls.sql` in the Supabase SQL Editor.
3. Backfill existing transactions by replacing the email in the commented query in that SQL file with your account email, then run the query.
4. Set `TRACKR_OWNER_ID` to your Auth user UUID in `.env.local` and in Vercel. Find the UUID in Supabase Authentication under Users.

The dashboard and transaction API require a signed-in account. Row-level security limits transaction access to that account. The allowance cron uses `TRACKR_OWNER_ID` to add a £40 morning allowance daily at 08:00 UTC. The dashboard's daily allowance metric shows £40 minus expenses recorded today.
